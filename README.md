PURPOSE
=======
This instruction manual is solely made to improve the (in my opinion) unclear instruction from the main manual. The original rules were combined with some custom made rules from a Ski-Holiday with too many time spent in UNO-Practice

LICENSE
=======
Although in the creation of this document I tended to a **GNU General Public License**, as I generally prefer open source and copylefted Software, right now, I prefer publishing this document under the **WTFPL** restrictions. 
Bottom Line: Just take whatever you want; However, I would appreciate if you would name me in any fork projects.

LINK TO ORIGINAL FILE
=====================
This Document is completely designated to the Tabletop Simulator Steam Workshop File "Extreme UNO", available under the Link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1811726058

I do not have any personal contact to the original creator of the Workshop file, however, I respect everything they created and I complement all improvements made for their projects.

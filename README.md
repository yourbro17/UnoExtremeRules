PURPOSE
=======
This instruction manual is solely made to improve the (in my opinion) unclear instruction from the main manual. The original rules were combined with some custom made rules from a Ski-Holiday with too much time spent in UNO-Practice

LICENSE
=======
I do not care. Let's just say I use **WTFPL**.

LINK TO ORIGINAL FILE
=====================
This Document is completely designated to the Tabletop Simulator Steam Workshop File "Extreme UNO", available under the Link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1811726058

I do not have any personal contact to the original creator of the Workshop file, however, I respect everything they created and I appreciate all improvements made for their projects.

EXTRA NOTE
==========
I'm from Germany, thus my English is not the finest. I'm open to any criticism.
